Although we appreciate and use Free Licenses when appropriate, these aren’t
solving the problems of copyright restrictions. Instead of trying to educate
everyone on the complexities of copyright law, we’d rather make our
intentions clear with this simple statement:

    ♡ Copying is an act of love. Please copy.
